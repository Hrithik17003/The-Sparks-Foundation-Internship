I have uploaded source code of my two sample task. 
Task 1 is prediction on percentage of a student based on number of study hours.
we have used linear regression algorithm to predict the percentage on our sample data.

Task 2 Prediction on unsupervised dataset where we dont have the dependent variable and we use k means algorithm 
to find clusters.
